  <ol>
    <li>
      <h2>Freelancing</h2>
      <p>One of the most popular ways to make money online is through freelancing. Websites like Upwork, Freelancer, and Fiverr connect freelancers with clients seeking various services such as writing, graphic design, programming, and digital marketing. By showcasing your skills and expertise, you can attract clients and earn money on a project-by-project basis.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>E-commerce</h2>
      <p>Setting up an online store is another lucrative option for making money online. Platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, and Etsy provide easy-to-use tools for creating and managing your own e-commerce website. Whether you're selling handmade crafts, dropshipping products, or digital downloads, e-commerce allows you to reach a global audience and generate passive income around the clock.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Affiliate Marketing</h2>
      <p>Affiliate marketing involves promoting products or services from other companies and earning a commission for every sale or lead generated through your referral. Popular affiliate networks such as Amazon Associates, ShareASale, and ClickBank offer a wide range of products to promote across various niches. By creating content such as blog posts, videos, or social media posts that incorporate affiliate links, you can earn passive income from your referrals.</p>
    </li>
